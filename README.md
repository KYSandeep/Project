This is a simple version of the game called Tron. It uses a simple queue to remember movements of the snakes. The entire project has been implemented using the ncurses library.
Also the A.I. uses the pthreads header file. the artificial intelligence that has been iplemented is the voronoi algorithm which checks for the maximum number of array space the bot can catpture while making sure the user gets less than it.
